Outline:
An album of ambient music incorporating soundscapes from Gaza pre-destruction. To be listened to as an act of hope/resistance, 
and to garner substantial royalties to go directly to chosen NGOs aiding Palestine on an ongoing basis.

Social Context:
Gaza is in a state of destruction with human atrocities being committed beyond the scale of historic comprehension. 
People around the world are desperate for ways to support and respond to the crisis, and ways to show solidarity with Palestinian people.

Concept:
Ambient Gaza is designed to be an ambient long player i.e. to be listened to on repeat as background music. 
Produced by Ambient Gaza Collective and released by Sonic Ecology, every track incorporates a different soundscape from Gaza, including olive harvests, children playing, Gaza beach, and more. 
In listening to these sounds, there is an opportunity to grieve for the loss of life, and also the loss of ways of life in these places. 
There is also an invitation to embody these sounds so they do not fade, but remain within us, until they are heard again by the people of Palestine, in an act of hope and resistance. 
The idea for this album comes from one of Perera’s artworks compiling soundscapes from Gaza for London protest gatherings and vigils.

Fundraising:
According to Spotify data, listening to an album for 20-24 hours will generate royalties of around £1. 1000 listeners will generate £1000.00 per day, and over a month that will generate £30,000. 
A dedicated soft but extended campaign on socials would ask people to listen to keep Gaza in their hearts and simultaneously state that all funds from royalties will go towards helping Gaza, 
with a small percentage (no more than (1-5%) ensuring continual promotion of the album on socials and protest networks. The team will also create a small advisory panel to help guide the selection of suitable NGOs and splits of money raised. 
So far partners engaged to spread the word on socials include The Palestinian Sound Archive, Film-maker Mohammed Jabaly, Radio Alhara in Bethlehem, and the protest network in London and beyond.

Process:
Ambient Gaza is actively seeking soundscapes of Gaza pre- destruction. We already have a label and distribution partners to release the album on all platforms. 
We are seeking funds to create a small team that will continue outreach for soundscapes, help create more music and carry out an extended campaign to get people listening en masse all over the world. 
They will remain anonymous, centring listening over any personal gain or publicity. The soundscapes will be vetted for due diligence pre-release so that no person can be personally identified.
